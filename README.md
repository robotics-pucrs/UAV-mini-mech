# Miniaturized UAV Project Using Nationally Available Components

This repository documents the development of a small-sized quadrotor UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) using only components available through online marketplaces within the Brazilian market. The project is being developed within the **Autonomous Systems Laboratory (LSA)** at **PUCRS**.

## 💡 Motivation

With the rise of mobile robotics and the miniaturization of technological nodes, numerous open-source UAV projects have emerged within enthusiast communities. However, the limited availability of certain components in Brazil makes it difficult to locally produce lightweight UAVs (weight < 50g), especially for **swarm applications**.

This project aims to address that gap by developing a viable UAV platform using only locally available parts.

## 📁 About this Repository

This GitHub repository will be used to **store, version, and document all project iterations**, including:

- 3D frame design files  
- Electrical schematics and circuit diagrams  
- Microcontroller source code  
- Experimental data and performance curves  
- Technical notes and design decisions  

## 🧩 Project Structure

The project is organized into three main phases:

1. **3D Frame Printing**  
   - Frame modeled in CAD and printed in PLA  
   - Multiple design proposals created and tested  
   - Preliminary validation via fitting tests  
   ✅ *Completed*

2. **Installation of Electrical Components** *(current phase)*  
   - Development and testing of motor drivers and voltage regulators  
   - DC motor integration with the electrical circuit  
   - Power consumption curve measurements  
   - Preparing for PWM-based control via the microcontroller  

3. **Microcontroller Programming**  
   - Control logic implementation and sensor integration  
   - Flight testing and parameter calibration  
   - Finalization of the UAV platform  

## 📅 Timeline

- 🏁 Start: [optional start date]  
- 📌 Estimated completion: **February 2025**  
- 🚀 By project end, functional UAV prototypes will be completed, with the final application still under development.

## 🎯 Future Applications

Once complete, the miniaturized UAVs will be used in:

- **Swarm robotics** projects  
- **Active signaling** in dynamic environments  
- **Disaster and climate incident response**

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools

- 3D printing (PLA)  
- CAD tools for frame modeling  
- Microcontrollers with PWM support  
- Sensors and actuators from local suppliers  
- Embedded programming (languages and IDEs)
